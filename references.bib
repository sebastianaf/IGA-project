The design is based on a low-cost PZEM-004T, using non-invasive CT sensors, SD3004 electric energy measurement chip and ESP8266 Wemos D1 mini microcontroller for retrieving data from sensor nodes and sending data to server via internet. The experimental results showed that the developed energy monitoring system can successfully record the voltage, current, active power and accumulative power consumption.},

  abstract  = {Water is always a crucial part of everyday life. Due to global environmental situation, water management and conservation is vital for human survival. In recent times, there were huge needs of consumer based humanitarian projects that could be rapidly developed using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In this paper, we propose an IoT based water monitoring system that measures water level in real-time. Our prototype is based on idea that the level of the water can be very important parameter when it comes to the flood occurrences especially in disaster prone areas. A water level sensor is used to detect the desired parameter, and if the water level reaches the parameter, the signal will be feed in realtime to social network like Twitter. A cloud server was configured as data repository. The measurement of the water levels are displayed in remote dashboard.},
